1. introduction

fnkey is a tool for helping user to play with the function key of YeeLoong
netbook.  it is originally written by Cui Chunbo<cuicb@lemote.com> from Lemote.

2. principle

there is a SCI(system control interrupt) in YeeLoong netbook for handling the
function keys(including LID open/close, AC plugin/out). when any of the
function key operation take place, there will be a SCI interrupt send to CPU,
then EC(Embedded Controller) module will handle the interrupt and output
according information to /proc/sci.

fnkey, run as a daemon, it will poll the interface, if any information catched
from /proc/sci, it will draw some information configured in fnkey.conf to the
screen and do the according actions configured in default.sh.

3. install

please read INSTALL

NOTE:

fnkey depends on the /proc/sci interface(provided by EC module), and this fnkey
is merged into the kernel source code and put into tools/fnkey.

this fnkey works with the following /proc/sci/ interface:

$ cat /proc/sci
0x2d    8
0x2d    7
0x2c    0
...

if you are using the old /proc/sci interface, please update your EC module or
use the EC module maintained in the kernel(>=2.6.30) source code and ensure the
following options is selected:

CONFIG_EC_KB3310B
