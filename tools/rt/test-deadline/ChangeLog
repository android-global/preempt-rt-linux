    Update and bugfix for the Makefile

     - include dependencies for the targets
     - add an 'all' target to compile both tests

    CPU-hog test added
    
    A simple test program is added designed such that each of its
    threads consumes all the CPU bandwidth it is assigned.
    
    This is of help while testing the isolation/bandwidth enforcement
    the scheduling algorithm is able to provide.
